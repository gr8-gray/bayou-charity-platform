// Single source of truth for the gallery storage-bucket contract.
//
// THE CONTRACT: a photo's `gallery_submissions.status` decides which bucket its
// URL points at — 'approved' → gallery-public, anything else → gallery-pending.
// That only works if approving a photo ALSO copies the object from
// gallery-pending into gallery-public BEFORE the status flips. The 2026-07
// broken-gallery bug happened because approval flipped the status but never
// moved the file: every approved photo's URL pointed at gallery-public while
// the object still lived in gallery-pending. If you touch the approve flow
// (AdminGalleryManager.handleApprove), keep the order: copy first, flip second,
// and never flip if the copy failed.
//
// Approval COPIES, it does not move: the pending object stays behind so
// reject-after-approve can fall back to it after the public copy is removed.
// Delete cleans both buckets (app/actions/gallery.ts).
//
// Trap: gallery-pending is a PRIVATE bucket (verified in prod storage.buckets).
// Public-style URLs for pending/rejected photos therefore 400 — pending
// thumbnails need a signed URL or an authenticated fetch to actually render.
// gallery-public IS public, so approved URLs serve anonymously.
